* **Pr채sens** is useful for writing and speaking and **Pr채sens Perfekt**  is useful for speaking and sometime for writing
* **Pr채teritum** is generally used during writing not speaking
* **Futur I** is very less important. People normally use **Pr채sens** to express future. 
* * Example: **Tomorrow I will go to cinema** > **Morgen gehe ich ins kino** offcourse you can also say **Morgen werde ich ins kino gehen** but first one is mostly used
