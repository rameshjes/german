# Wo-Wörter (Wo-Compounds)

**Wo = what**
* We know that preposition always adds noun after that. This concept makes sure that is valid.
Example :

```
Write Following sentence in German: 

What do you believe in?  (believe in = glaube an)

Was glaube Sie an?  (This would be wrong, because there is no noun after preposition (an) )

So we will use Wo-worter

Woran glaube Sie?  (An is combined with Was to make it as --> Woran)
```

**Formula** `was + prep` = Wo-Wörter
